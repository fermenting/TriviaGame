# TriviaGame
There's nothing trivial about this game!

## A work in progress

I had high hopes for this assignment. My confidence level was medium, I had actually coded something by this point. However, learning the intricacies of HTML, CSS, Javascript & JQuery are still ahead of me, not behind me.

I have laid out the steps that would need to be taken for this game to work. Logically, the foundation is there. However, it does not function in time for the deadline.

Here's a list of what's broken:

### The Hit List

* The functions execute when the browser loads, or not at all
* The timer function is not timing right.
* The buttons do not populate answers that are viewable.
* The logic for checking answers is definitely suspect.
* The CSS is non-existent.


## The Silver Lining

I'm happy with the question bank, and I know that I'm not an impossible distance from getting it to work. I will make this a page worth seeing! I learned a ton about objects, JQuery, and Javascript in the process of making this.
